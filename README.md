# LAB - Number

## Project Name

I built an app that displays three products and allows a user to vote for one. It records the amount of times each product is displayed and the number of times they vote for that project. The app finishes by displyaing the results that were recorded. This app is used by Odd Duck to determine which products that users would be interested in.
